## Problem Statement

Calcium imaging is a technique for observing neuron activity as a series of images showing indicator fluorescence over time. Manually segmenting neurons is time-consuming, leading to research on automated calcium imaging segmentation. We want to design a model that will handle a high-dimensional, large-scale image segmentation problem. Our goal is to locate the neurons and segment them out from the surrounding image, given large sets of tiff images, as accurately as possible.


## Dataset
The datasets we used to train and test is provided by Dr. Shannon Quinn for the course CSCI 8360: Data Science Practicum.

There are total 9(test) Dataset which are being evaluated.

Training and Testing Dataset can also be found on below website:
